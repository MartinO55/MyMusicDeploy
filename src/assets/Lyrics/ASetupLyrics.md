# Verse 1

I thought I knew what love was all about
But you came and turned my world inside out
I thought I had it all figured out
But now I'm standing here with my heart in doubt

Chorus:
Cause you were a set up, a set up
You played me like a fool, I was a set up
I can't believe I fell for your lies
But now I see the truth, you were a set up

Verse 2:
I gave you my heart, my trust, my all
But you just used me to have a ball
I thought we had a future, a destiny
But now I see, it was all just a set up for me

Chorus:
Cause you were a set up, a set up
You played me like a fool, I was a set up
I can't believe I fell for your lies
But now I see the truth, you were a set up

Bridge:
I'll pick up the pieces, move on with my life
I'll find someone new, someone who's right
I won't let you bring me down, I'll rise above
Cause I'm stronger than you, you were a set up

Chorus:
Cause you were a set up, a set up
You played me like a fool, I was a set up
I can't believe I fell for your lies
But now I see the truth, you were a set up

Outro:
I'm moving on, leaving you behind
I'll find love that's true, love that's kind
I won't let you break me, I'll stand tall
Cause you were a set up, you were a set up after all.
