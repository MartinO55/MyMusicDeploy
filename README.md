# My Fictional Music

this is a react website I through together to display some of the AI generated album covers, band names and descriptions I got playing around with chatGPT and some other websites.

It's built in react and SASS.

this is a Cloned Repo I set Up to make the site deployable - The original Repo can be found here, along with the actual commit log: <https://github.com/MartinO55/MyMusic/tree/main/myMusic>
